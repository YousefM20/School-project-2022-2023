School-project-2022-2023 (coding with my friend "Ziad Hamed")

First, to open the program, click(Capstone Program\bin\Debug\net7.0-windows). You should download net framework 7 to be able to open the program. You can download it from this link:

This project is composed of two sections. First, the data
collection section, which uses high-accurate sensors to monitor CO₂ levels, Total
Dissolved Solids (TDS), and temperature within the Sea. The second section is
the data analysis and prediction, a program that analyses the collected data, how
they correlate with each other, and then proposes predictions regarding how these
data will be in the future.

This project was designed to tackle the climate change in Egypt by monitoring
the indicators of climate change in Red Sea and utilizing means of data analysis,
including statistical, diagnostic, and predictive analysis. The project achieved a
low error value for the collected data, high accuracy in predicting future data, and
fast and optimized performance in the program, which indicates that the project
achieved both design requirements. The project also showed a strong correlation
between the parameters of CO2 concentration, water temperature, water TDS, and
reflected on how the TDS is expected to decrease by a critical value given the
current progression of climate change. As proven by research from Texas
university, that will heavily impact the reproductivity and the embryonic
development of marine animals, which will in turn cause multiple species to
vanish in the future. Furthermore, that expected decrease of TDS will cause
multiple Coral Reefs species to go extinct, causing the disappearance of an
important marine-life habitat and the imbalance of the marine-life ecosystem.
